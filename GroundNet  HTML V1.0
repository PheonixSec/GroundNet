<b>Welcome to GroundNet!!</b>
<body>What is GroundNet?</body>
<p>GroundNet is the new and improved anonimity network! We draw inspiration from Tor and I2P,  and  we love both of these tools.
But we also have watched them be the targets of new private and government attacks. We aim to provide a new netowork that will have new tools
and accessories. In short, we want to keep the legacy of both these programs alive.</p>
<bodyWhat are the new tools?></body>
<p>We plan to incorporate both Tor hidden services and I2P's eepsites into our network. But we also plan to build our own version of hidden services.
We will include encrypted IRC and a supported crypto wallet. We plan to include our own hidden services, but we plan to accomplish this for free.
We want to provide people with a method of hosting on our network, and this will allow us to keep any illegal activity off our network.</p>
<b>How is this private?</b>
<p>We will use the same encryption standards as Tor, and use the same node methods with our own twist on it. Your real IP will still be encrypted and hidden,
just with a different protocol and sequence.</p>
<b>How can I help?</b>
<p>There are two ways you can help. First is by donating crypto currency to our cause. The second is by running tests against our network,
and making us aware of any problems or bugs in our software.</p>
